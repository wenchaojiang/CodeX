abstract = {In disasters such as the earthquake in Haiti and the tsunami in Japan, people used social media to ask for help or report injuries. The popularity, efficiency, and ease of use of social media has led to its pervasive use during the disaster. This creates a pool of timely reports about the disaster, injuries, and help requests. This offers an alternative opportunity for first responders and disaster relief organizations to collect information about the disaster, victimis, and their needs. It also presents a challenge for these organizations to aggregate and process the requests from different social media. Given the sheer volume of requests, it is necessary to filter reports and select those of high priority for decision making. Little is known about how the two phases should be smoothly integrated. In this paper we report the use of social media during a simulated crisis and crisis response process, the ASU Crisis Response Game. Its main objective is to create a training capability to understand how to use social media in crisis. We report lessons learned from this exercise that may benefit first responders and NGOs who use social media to manage relief efforts during the disaster.},

Analysis of these experiences yields new insights into the nature of context. We show how context is more socially than technically constructed. We show how players exploited (and resolved conflicts between) multiple indications of context including GPS, GPS error, audio talk, ambient audio, timing, local knowledge and trust. We recommend not overly relying on GPS, extensively using audio, and extending interfaces to represent GPS error.},

Video in Qualitative Research provides practical guidance for students and academics on how to use video in qualitative research, how to address the problems and issues that arise in undertaking video-based field studies and how to subject video recordings to detailed scrutiny and analysis. Heath, Hindmarsh and Luff consider the ethical and practical issues that arise in recording and gathering data as well as how video enables new and distinctive ways of presenting insights, observations and findings to both academic and practitioner audiences. The book is illustrated throughout with a wide range of case material drawn from the authors own research projects, and these cases serve to situate the practical and methodological guidance offered by the book into real research scenarios. Video in Qualitative Research is an invaluable guide for students and researchers across the social sciences thinking of using video as part of their research.

It investigates human activities, such as talk, nonverbal interaction, and the use of artifacts and technologies, identifying routine practices and problems and the resources for their solu- tion. Its roots lie in ethnography (especially participant observation), socio- linguistics, ethnomethodology, conversation analysis, kinesics, proxemics, and ethology. Video technology has been vital in establishing Interaction Analysis, which depends on the technology of audiovisual recording for its primary records and on playback capability for their analysis.* Only electronic recording produces the kind of data corpus that allows the close interrogation required for Interaction Analysis. In particular, it provides the crucial ability to replay a sequence of interaction repeatedly for multiple viewers-and on multiple occasions.},

With funding from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the IML is now developing the Virtual Terrorism Response Academy, which uses game technology to prepare first responders for rescue efforts in which hazardous materials may be involved. This paper looks at the taxonomy of related game genres, the history of the "Virtual Clinic" concept that shapes the user's spatial experience, and the original rationale for creating what Max Boisot calls "epistemology space." From the perspective of an outside researcher, it also offers an account of the VRTA desginers' responses to potential criticism from learning specialists in game studies who object that the game is too didactic and discourages trial-and-error by restraining the learner in the narrative conceit of a "simulation of a simulation." The author argues that despite an understandable emphasis on the rhetorical situation of professional communication and the chain of command, the tendencies of the game's mechanics to emphasize multiple-choice testing rather than exploit potential spatial enhancements could detract from the effectiveness of the game.},

Now games can be designed to be played in public spaces like shopping malls, conferences, museums and other non-traditional game venues. Game designers need to understand how to use the world as a gamespace-and both the challenges and advantages of doing so. This book shows how to change the face of play-who plays, when and where they play and what that play means to all involved. The authors explore aspects of pervasive games that concern game designers: what makes these games compelling, what makes them possible today and how they are made. For game researchers, it provides a solid theoretical, philosophical and aesthetic understanding of the genre. Pervasive Games covers everything from theory and design to history and marketing. designers, so that they can learn how to engage players' real-time experiences beyond the mobile phone or computer screen. -Thirteen case studies with illustrative and inspiring examples make the entire pervasive games design space tangible. -Provides practical design tips, potential pitfalls, design problems from real games, and inspiration from some of the most interesting pervasive game designers in the world, including Matt Adams, Frank Lantz, and others.},

We found the teams through an inductive analysis of Twitter communications acquired over the three-week emergency period from 89,114 Twitterers. We then analyzed the teams’ Twitter streams, as well as all digital media they generated and pointed to in their streams—blog posts, photographs, videos, status updates and field reports—to understand the medical coordination challenges they faced from pre-deployment readiness to on- the-ground action. Here we identify opportunities for improving coordination in a decentralized and distributed environment where staffing, disease trajectories, and other circumstances rapidly change. We extrapolate from these findings to theorize about how “beaconing” behavior is a sign of latent potential for coordination upon which mechanisms of coordination can capitalize.},

The five basic kinds of illocutionary acts are: representatives (or assertives), directives, commissives, expressives, and declarations. Each of these notions is defined. An earlier attempt at constructing a taxonomy by Austin is defective for several reasons, especially in its lack of clear criteria for distinguishing one kind of illocutionary force from another.

The present paper reports results from a study comparing high- versus low-identification emergency mass emergency survivors to test the interlinked claims (1) that shared identity in an emergency crowd enhances expressions of solidarity and reduces 'panic' behaviour and (2) that such a shared identity can arise from the shared experience of the emergency itself. Qualitative and descriptive quantitative analyses were carried out on interviews with 21 survivors of 11 emergencies. The analysis broadly supports these two claims. The study therefore points to the usefulness of a new approach to mass emergency behaviour, based on self-categorization theory (SCT).},
