\chapter{Conclusion}
Three studies have been done. For each study, systems with different interaction design patterns is field trialled. The first one is a non agent version of the game. The second and third studies are about HuOL and HuIL interaction pattern. 
Through field 
\section{Summary of findings}
Three study happen iteratively, implications and requirements and implications generated in previous study are feedback to the next 
\subsection{HuOL vs HuIL}
It is unfair to say HuOL is worse then HuIL 

%insert figure to do comparision.

This two studies actually give implications to each other 

1. maintain situational awareness of the key no matter what 

\subsection{The role of HQ}
1. Whole manual is 
2. The coordination overhead incurred by the agent planning. Generate 2 implications: involving human ; better modelling
Reliability and capability of the agent would be the key issue. Flexibility and maintain situational awareness. 
3. A rebalance make things better but still, the problem exists. 


\subsection{Common Ground}
Which is the common theme


\section{Limitation}


\section{future work}
What can we take away from it? Implication for future work?
