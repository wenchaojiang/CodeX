An ideal emergency management information system allows crisis response teams to act decisively within tight time schedules and with incomplete information. To improve emergency management systems, the focus should be placed on making the interaction between individuals and computers as seamless as possible, providing workers with a method of avoiding information overload and allowing them to absorb and judge information rapidly.},
