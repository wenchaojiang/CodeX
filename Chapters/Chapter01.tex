%************************************************
Coordination in Disaster Response (DR) operations such as Urban Search And Rescue (USAR) can be very challenging. In large-scale disaster, DR teams may have limited resource and personnels to deal with multiple incidents across a large impact area. Task planning and execution need to be carried out by geographically distributed DR teams in real time against uncertainties in the environment. The challenges highlight the opportunity space of technology support for real time task planning and execution.  \\ 

Recently, various Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), ranging from communication infrastructures to social media platforms, have been playing increasingly significant role in the disaster management.  Moreover, Muti-agent system researchers have devised various real-time task planning algorithms to automate planning in time critical task domains such as disaster response. The advances in both ICT and Multi-agent optimisation algorithms lead to the opportunity of intelligent planning support in the DR domain. However, before we apply this algorithm to to support DR operations, we need to understand how can we design the interaction between responder team and the planning support in a way that improve, rather than hinder team performance. [....] The aim of this work is aimed to explore potential socio-technical issues surrounding a planning support system, which in turn, informs interaction design of such systems. \\

This PhD work is a ORCHID sponsored research, which contributes to the understanding needed to build Human Agent Collectives (HACs) in disaster domain. As computational systems  becoming increasingly embedded into our life, the researchers from ORDHID project envision a future in which people and computational agents operates at a global scale, forming human agent collectives. The ORCHID project is aimed to realise the vision of HACs by studying the science that is needed to understand, build and apply HACs that symbiotically interleave human and computer systems (www.orchid.ac.uk).\\

This chapter will give an overview of the PhD work, which covers research objectives, approach, research questions and contributions, followed by a list of publications related to this thesis and an overview of the thesis structure.\\


\section{Problem Definition and Objectives}
In large scale disasters, Disaster Response (DR) team may have limited resource and personnels to deal with large amount of incidents across large geographic area under time pressure. In this situation, task and team allocation become a grand challenge for DR team. The responders and resources need to be assigned to teams and tasks in a way that to minimise loss of life and costs (e.g., time or money) . For instance responders with different capabilities (e.g., fire-fighting or life support) have to form teams in order to perform rescue tasks (e.g., extinguishing a fire or providing first aid). Thus, responders have to plan their paths to the tasks (as these may be distributed in space) and form specific teams to complete them. These teams, in turn, may need to disband and reform in different configurations to complete new tasks, taking into account the status of the current tasks (e.g., health of victims or building fire) and the environment (e.g., if a fire or radioactive cloud is spreading). Furthermore, uncertainty in the environment (e.g.,road connectivity, task status update) or in the responders abilities to complete tasks (e.g., some may be tired or get hurt) means that plans are likely to change continually to reflect the prevailing assessment of the situation.\\

Recent advances in multi-agent systems research leads to a number of real-time simulation and optimization technologies, some of which has great potential to be adapted to support task planning for DR teams (More details, see section x). Although the opportunity space has been recognised, most multi-agent coordination algorithms has only be tested in computational simulations. None of them has be deployed to guide real human in DR situations. However, extreme difficulties might be encountered when introducing new technology support for human teams. New technologies might not support, but may disrupt smooth workflow if they are designed in an organisationally unacceptable way. Many CSCW literatures have pointed out ill-designed work-flow management/automation system can lead to undesirable results, not only fail to improve work efficiency but also hinders human performance. Field studies of CSCW technologies have shown that it is vital to study technology in use to understand potential tensions raised for teamwork.  \\

We believe the same is true for automated planning support. Before we can build automated systems that support human task planning, field trials are required to understand the potential impact of technology support for team coordination. Although most multi-agent coordination algorithms have been tested to perform well in the computational simulations, they have never been excised to guide real human responders in the real world environment. Currently, there are few studies aimed to unpack the interactional issues relating to a socio-technical aspects of the intelligent planning support system. The objective of this PhD work is to fill this gap by exploring and unpacking interactional issues surrounding the intelligent planning support system from a socio-technical perspective.\\

\section{Approach}\label{sec:custom}

To meet our research objective, we adopt a serious-mixed reality games approach (Fischer et al., 2012) to create a game probe (i.e. AtomicOrchid) that enables studying team interaction with planning support system in a real-world disaster scenario whilst providing confidence in the efficacy of behavioural observations. Mixed-reality games bridge the physical and the digital (Benford et al., 2005). Arguably, They serve as a vehicle to study distributed interactions across multiple devices and ubiquitous computing environments in the wild (Crabtree et al., 2006).\\

The AtomicOrchid [reference the AO2012 paper] is a serious mixed-reality game designed to mirror aspects of real-world disaster. In this game, field responders use smartphones to coordinate, via text messaging, GPS, and maps, with headquarters players and each other. The players in the game faces a distributed task planning problem with both time and spatial constraints. To achieve game objectives, the players need to dynamically change their team configurations. The task planning process in the game is supported by a planning support agent software. The planning support agent is based on a state-of-art coalition formation optimisation technology.  In Chapter x, design and implementation of AtomicOrchid will be introduced in more details.\\

In order to explore the socio-technical issues in agent-based planning support systems, three studies are conducted with different research focuses. In the 1st study, field responders and incident commander coordinate without support of the intelligent planner. The study establish baseline performance of the game play and derived several requirements for planning support system. In the second and third studies, an intelligent planner was introduced to support task planning with two different interaction designs. The second study adopts a arrangement of human On-the-loop in which the planning agent automatically generate plans and instruct field players to execute plans. In the third study, we adopts an human In-the-loop design in which every plan generated by planning agent will need to be approved and edited before it is sent to field players before execution. More details of these two interaction patterns will be introduced in Chapter \ref{ch:approach}.\\

The work also adopted an ethnographically-inspired approach for data analysis. Game plays were recorded and qualitative interaction analysis were carried out to unpack socio-technical issues.\\


\section{Scoping}\label{sec:custom}

This thesis is relevant to several research areas. \\

\begin{itemize} 
  \item Human Computer Interaction (HCI) for Disaster Response(DR). With the vision of HACs system, the current ICT for DR may eventually evolve into HACs in the future. The thesis is aimed to help realise the vision by providing design implications for ICT systems with intelligent task planning agents from a HCI perspective. 
  \item Multi-agent systems. The muli-agent simulation technologies underpin the technical possibility of intelligent planning support, providing the opportunity space of human agent collective planning. 
  \item Human agent interaction. Existing human agent interaction research is the overarching research area of this thesis. 
  \item Ethnography. The thesis adopts a Ethnographically-inspired approach to study human system interactions in field trials.
\end{itemize}

There are various ICT and AI-based technologies supporting disaster management activities in the different stages of the crisis circle including preparedness, response and recovery. This thesis is going to limit the scope on operations of rescue and evacuation in the immediate aftermath of a disaster impact, which typically requires high level of team coordination and real-time task planning and execution.\\ 

The thesis also focus on socio-technical issues related to human team interacting with the intelligent planning support from a HCI perspective. The work involves planning support agents based on multi-agent coordination algorithms, but the effectiveness of particular coordination algorithms are not concern of this work.\\

As part of ORCHID project, the AtomicOrhid serious game platform was developed as A research "Probe" to trial human agent collective planning in the domain of disaster response. As mentioned in section x.x,  the AtomicOrchid platform consists of two major components: a game engine, and a embeded task planning agent. The core game engine was developed , deployed and maintained by the author, whereas the task planning agent was developed by ORCHID research partners - Feng Wu and Savapali Ramchun. Both Feng and Ramchun have expertise and research interest in the performance of task planning algorithm, where the author's research interest is the interaction between human and the intelligent task planning agent. 

\section{Research quetions}
The recent advances in ICT and multi-agent optimisation technologies have created the opportunity space for intelligent planning support system in disaster response domain. Before we deploy such a planning support system, a deep understanding of socio-technical issues are required for appropriate interaction design between human teams and computational agents. This work adopted serious game approach to explore the interaction design space. Integrated with intelligent planning support, the AtomicOrchid game platform is used as a testbed for human agent interaction techniques.  The AtomicOrchid is further configured with two different interaction patterns to produce game "probes" for field trials. Through field observation, this work is aimed answer the following two research questions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item[A] What socio-technical issues will emerge if we try to automate planning process in a disaster response team? socio-technical issues can be seen as an term for the issues relating socio-technical gap often found in the CSCW systems, which can range from social, organisational to other interface design issues. This work is aimed to conduct an exploration of the socio-technical issues in the interaction design space of agent planning support.

\item[B] How can we design interaction to support human agent collaboration in task planning?
Following the first question, the emerged socio-technical issues will need to be handled with approprate interaction design. This work seeks to produce interaction design implications through field observation and interaction analysis, both of which are grounded in literatures(Chapter \ref{ch:methodology})
\end{enumerate}

Both two questions will be answered with respect to the two different interaction patterns which will be detailed in Chapter \ref{ch:approach}.
