abstract = {Workflow management is a technology that is considered strategically important by many businesses, and its market growth shows no signs of abating. It is, however, often viewed with skepticism by the research community, conjuring up visions of oppressed workers performing rigidly-defined tasks on an assembly line. Although the potential for abuse no doubt exists, workflow management can instead be used to help individuals manage their work and to provide a clear context for performing that work. A key challenge in the realization of this ideal is the reconciliation of workflow process models and software with the rich variety of activities and behaviors that comprise “real” work. Our experiences with the InConcert workflow management system are used as a basis for outlining several issues that will need to be addressed in meeting this challenge. This is intended as an invitation to CSCW researchers to influence this important technology in a constructive manner by drawing on research and experience.},

abstract = {The use of nuclear power plants to produce electric energy is a safety-critical process where ultimate operational decisions still relies with the control room operators. Thus it is important to provide the best possible decision support through effective supervisory control interfaces. A human centered design approach, based on cognitive task analysis methods, was used to observe the operators training on the nuclear power plant simulator of the Human System Interface Laboratory (LABIHS). We noted deficiencies in graphic interface design, alarm system and in the integration between the computerized interfaces and the hardcopy (paper) procedures. A new prototype of the interface including graphics, alarms and digital procedures was designed as an alternative to the current hardcopy procedure manuals. The design improves upon the graphical layout of system information and provides better integration of procedures, automation, and alarm systems. The new design was validated by expert opinion and a performance comparison with the existing design.},

The crew and ground support personnel will want to control and be informed by these systems at varying levels of detail depending on the situation. Moreover, these systems will need to operate safely in the presence of people and cooperate with them effectively. We call such autonomous systems human-centered in contrast with traditional “black-box” autonomous systems. Our goal is to design a framework for human-centered autonomous systems that enables users to interact with these systems at whatever level of control is most appropriate whenever they so choose, but minimize the necessity for such interaction. This paper discusses on-going research at the NASA Ames Research Center and the Johnson Space Center in developing human-centered autonomous systems that can be used for space missions.},

abstract = {Crowd behaviour in emergencies has previously been explained in terms of either 'mass panic' or strength of pre-existing social bonds. The present paper reports results from a study comparing high- versus low-identification emergency mass emergency survivors to test the interlinked claims (1) that shared identity in an emergency crowd enhances expressions of solidarity and reduces 'panic' behaviour and (2) that such a shared identity can arise from the shared experience of the emergency itself. Qualitative and descriptive quantitative analyses were carried out on interviews with 21 survivors of 11 emergencies. The analysis broadly supports these two claims. The study therefore points to the usefulness of a new approach to mass emergency behaviour, based on self-categorization theory (SCT).},

abstract = {Organizational coordination has traditionally been viewed from an organizational-design perspective where rules, modalities, and structures are used to meet the information-processing demands of the environment. Fast-response organizations face unique coordination challenges as they operate under conditions of high uncer- tainty and fast decision making, where mistakes can be catastrophic. Based on an in-depth investigation of the coordination practices of a medical trauma center where fast-response and error-free activities are essential requirements, we develop a coordination-practice perspective that emphasizes expertise coordination and dia- logic coordination. We argue that expertise coordination practices (reliance on protocols, community of practice structuring, plug-and-play teaming, and knowledge sharing) are essential to manage distributed expertise and ensure the timely application of necessary expertise. We suggest that dialogic coordination practices (epistemic contestation, joint sensemaking, cross-boundary intervention, and protocol breaking) are time-critical responses to novel events and ensure error-free operation. However, dialogic coordination practices are highly contested because of epistemic differences, reputation stakes, and possible blame apportionment.},

In the first, the players were online and professional performers were on the streets. The second reversed this relationship. Analysis of these experiences yields new insights into the nature of context. We show how context is more socially than technically constructed. We show how players exploited (and resolved conflicts between) multiple indications of context including GPS, GPS error, audio talk, ambient audio, timing, local knowledge and trust. We recommend not overly relying on GPS, extensively using audio, and extending interfaces to represent GPS error.},

abstract = {Within the ATAL community, the belief-desire-intention (BDI) model has come to be possibly the best known and best studied model of practical reasoning agents. However, it could be argued that the BDI model is now becoming somewhat dated: the principles of the architecture were established in the mid-1980s, and have remained essentially unchanged since then. With the explosion of interest in intelligent agents and multi-agent systems that has occurred since then, a great many other architectures have been developed, which, it could be argued, address some issues that the BDI model fundamentally fails to. The purpose of this paper is therefore to establish how the BDI model stands in relation to other contemporary models of agency, and where it should go next.},

Increasing system autonomy, complexity and information fluctuations make it extremely difficult to develop static support concepts that cover all critical situations after implementing the system. Therefore, support systems in dynamic domains should be dynamic as the domain itself. This paper elaborates on the state information needed from the operator to generate effective mitigation strategies. We describe implications of a real world experiment onboard three frigates of the Royal Netherlands Navy. Although new techniques allow us to measure, combine and gain insight in physiological, subjective and task information, many practical issues need to be solved.},

abstract = {Prior work suggests that the potential benefits of mixed initiative management of multiple robots are mitigated by situational factors, including workload and operator expertise. In this paper, we present an experiment where allowing a supervisor and group of searchers to jointly decide the correct level of autonomy for a given situation (“mixed initiative”) results in better overall performance than giving an agent exclusive control over their level of autonomy (“adaptive autonomy”) or giving a supervisor exclusive control over the agent’s level of autonomy (“adjustable autonomy”), regardless of the supervisor’s expertise or workload. In light of prior work, we identify two elements of our experiment that appear to be requirements for effective mixed initiative control of large-scale robotic teams: (a) Agents must be capable of making progress toward a goal without having to wait for human input in most circumstances. (b) The operator control interface must help the human to rapidly understand and modify the progress and intent of several agents.},

abstract = {Previous studies have shown the importance of workflow issues in the implementation of CPOE systems and patient safety practices. To understand the impact of CPOE on clinical workflow, we developed a conceptual framework and conducted a literature search for CPOE evaluations between 1990 and June 2007. Fifty-one publications were identified that disclosed mixed effects of CPOE systems. Among the frequently reported workflow advantages were the legible orders, remote accessibility of the systems, and the shorter order turnaround times. Among the frequently reported disadvantages were the time-consuming and problematic user-system interactions, and the enforcement of a predefined relationship between clinical tasks and between providers. Regarding the diversity of findings in the literature, we conclude that more multi-method research is needed to explore CPOE's multidimensional and collective impact on especially collaborative workflow.},

abstract = {Recent world-wide crisis events have drawn new attention to the role information communication technology (ICT) can play in warning and response activities. Drawing on disaster social science, we consider a critical aspect of post-impact disaster response that does not yet receive much information science research attention. Public participation is an emerging, large-scale arena for computer-mediated interaction that has implications for both informal and formal response. With a focus on persistent citizen communications as one form of interaction in this arena, we describe their spatial and temporal arrangements, and how the emerging information pathways that result serve different post-impact functions. However, command-and-control models do not easily adapt to the expanding data-generating and -seeking activities by the public. ICT in disaster contexts will give further rise to improvised activities and temporary organizations with which formal response organizations need to align.},

abstract = {Technical developments in computer hardware and software now make it possible to introduce automation into virtually all aspects of human-machine systems. Given these technical capabilities, which system functions should be automated and to what extent? We outline a model for types and levels of automation that provides a framework and an objective basis for making such choices. Appropriate selection is important because automation does not merely supplant but changes human activity and can impose new coordination demands on the human operator. We propose that automation can be applied to four broad classes of functions: 1) information acquisition; 2) information analysis; 3) decision and action selection; and 4) action implementation. Within each of these types, automation can be applied across a continuum of levels from low to high, i.e., from fully manual to fully automatic. A particular system can involve automation of all four types at different levels. The human performance consequences of particular types and levels of automation constitute primary evaluative criteria for automation design using our model. Secondary evaluative criteria include automation reliability and the costs of decision/action consequences, among others. Examples of recommended types and levels of automation are provided to illustrate the application of the model to automation design.},

@article{Ramchurn2010,
abstract = {The coordination of emergency responders and robots to undertake a number of tasks in disaster scenarios is a grand challenge for multi-agent systems. Central to this endeavour is the problem of forming the best teams (coalitions) of responders to perform the various tasks in the area where the disaster has struck. Moreover, these teams may have to form, disband, and reform in different areas of the disaster region. This is because in most cases there will be more tasks than agents. Hence, agents need to schedule themselves to attempt each task in turn. Second, the tasks themselves can be very complex: requiring the agents to work on them for different lengths of time and having deadlines by when they need to be completed. The problem is complicated still further when different coalitions perform tasks with different levels of efficiency. Given all these facets, we define this as The Coalition Formation with Spatial and Temporal constraints problem (CFSTP).We show that this problem is NP-hardin particular, it contains the wellknown complex combinatorial problem of Team Orienteering as a special case. Based on this, we design a Mixed Integer Program to optimally solve small-scale instances of the CFSTP and develop new anytime heuristics that can, on average, complete 97\% of the tasks for large problems (20 agents and 300 tasks). In so doing, our solutions represent the first results for CFSTP.},

We found the teams through an inductive analysis of Twitter communications acquired over the three-week emergency period from 89,114 Twitterers. We then analyzed the teams’ Twitter streams, as well as all digital media they generated and pointed to in their streams—blog posts, photographs, videos, status updates and field reports—to understand the medical coordination challenges they faced from pre-deployment readiness to on- the-ground action. Here we identify opportunities for improving coordination in a decentralized and distributed environment where staffing, disease trajectories, and other circumstances rapidly change. We extrapolate from these findings to theorize about how “beaconing” behavior is a sign of latent potential for coordination upon which mechanisms of coordination can capitalize.},

abstract = {Classifier combination methods need to make best use of the outputs of multiple, imperfect classifiers to enable higher accuracy classifications. In many situations, such as when human decisions need to be combined, the base decisions can vary enormously in reliability. A Bayesian approach to such uncertain combination allows us to infer the differences in performance between individuals and to incorporate any available prior knowledge about their abilities when training data is sparse. In this paper we explore Bayesian classifier combination, using the computationally efficient framework of variational Bayesian inference. We apply the approach to real data from a large citizen science project, Galaxy Zoo Supernovae, and show that our method far outperforms other established approaches to imperfect decision combination. We go on to analyse the putative community structure of the decision makers, based on their inferred decision making strategies, and show that natural groupings are formed. Finally we present a dynamic Bayesian classifier combination approach and investigate the changes in base classifier performance over time.},

@article{Sukthankara,
abstract = {(from the chapter) Team behavior has almost exclusively been studied as involving humans interacting in tasks that require collective action to achieve success. Long a feature in science fiction, it recently has become technologically possible to create artificial entities that can serve as members of teams, as opposed to simply being automated systems operated by human team members. In the computing and robotics literature, such entities are called software agents. The term embodied agent is often used to describe physical robots in order to differentiate them from purely software agents; however, for the purposes of this chapter, we will use agent to refer to both because we intend to argue that some form of embodiment, virtual or physical, is an important element in establishing and maintaining membership in a team. The term intelligent agent is probably overly generous for describing the cognitive performance possible within the next decade, but implicit in the proposed elevation of status to teammate is the assumption that agents are capable of serving a role within the team that would otherwise have to be served by a human. This does not imply that human-level cognitive capability is feasible, required, or even desired, only that serving as a team member implies a different kind of interaction and collaboration with human team members than is expected of other forms of automation. If the agent must exhaustively consider interactions between its actions and the past and future actions of all other team members, achieving good teamwork becomes a computationally intensive problem. For the purpose of this survey, we limit our discussion of agents to pieces of software that (a) are autonomous, defined as capable of functioning independently for a significant length of time, (b) proactively act in anticipation of future events, and (c) are capable of self-reflection about their and their teammates' abilities. In this chapter, we will review research on multiagent systems, mixed initiative control, and agent interaction within human teams to evaluate the technological outlook, potential, and research directions for developing agents to serve as genuine team members.

abstract = {This report discusses some issues concerning serious games, that is, (digital) games used for purposes other than mere entertainment. The starting point is the serious games concept itself, and what the actually means. Further, serious games allow learners to experience situations that are impossible in the real world for reasons of safety, cost, time, etc., but they are also claimed to have positive impacts on the players development of a number of different skills. Subsequently, some possible positive (and negative) impacts of serious games are discussed. Further, some of the markets such games are used in are considered here, including, military games, government games, educational games, corporate games, and healthcare games. This report also identifies some (mainly academic) actors in the North American and the European serious games market. This report is part of the DISTRICT (Developing Industrial Strategies Through Innovative Cluster and Technologies) project: Serious Games Cluster and Business Network (SER3VG), which is part of the Interreg IIIC Programme.},

abstract = {Opportunities for participation by members of the public are expanding the information arena of disaster. Social media supports backchannel communications, allowing for wide-scale interaction that can be collectively resourceful, self-policing, and generative of information that is otherwise hard to obtain. Results from our study of information practices by members of the public during the October 2007 Southern California Wildfires suggest that community information resources and other backchannel communications activity enabled by social media are gaining prominence in the disaster arena, despite concern by officials about the legitimacy of information shared through such means. We argue that these emergent uses of social media are pre-cursors of broader future changes to the institutional and organizational arrangements of disaster response.},

@article{Turoff2004,
abstract = {This paper systematically develops a set of general and supporting design principles and specifications for a Dynamic Emergency Response Management Information System (DERMIS) by identifying design premises resulting from the use of the Emergency Management Information System and Reference Index (EMISARI) and design concepts resulting from a comprehensive literature review. Implicit in crises of varying scopes and proportions are communication and information needs that can be addressed by todays information and communication technologies. However, what is required is organizing the premises and concepts that can be mapped into a set of generic design principles in turn providing a framework for the sensible development of flexible and dynamic Emergency Response Information Systems. A framework is presented for the system design and development that addresses the communication and information needs of first responders as well as the decision making needs of command and control personnel. The framework also incorporates thinking about the value of insights and information from communities of geographically dispersed experts and suggests how that expertise can be brought to bear on crisis decision making. Historic experience is used to suggest nine design premises. These premises are complemented by a series of five design concepts based upon the review of pertinent and applicable research. The result is a set of eight general design principles and three supporting design considerations that are recommended to be woven into the detailed specifications of a DERMIS. The resulting DERMIS design model graphically indicates the heuristic taken by this paper and suggests that the result will be an emergency response system flexible, robust, and dynamic enough to support the communication and information needs of emergency and crisis personnel on all levels. In addition it permits the development of dynamic emergency response information systems with tailored flexibility to support and be integrated across different sizes and types of organizations. This paper provides guidelines for system analysts and designers, system engineers, first responders, communities of experts, emergency command and control personnel, and MIS/IT researchers.},

@article{Hayes-Roth1979,
abstract = {This paper presents a cognitive model of the planning process. The model generalizes the theoretical architecture of the Hearsay-II system. Thus, it assumes that planning comprises the activities of a variety of cognitive "specialists." Each specialist can suggest certain kinds of decisions for incorporation into the plan in progress, These include decisions about: (a) how to approach the planning problem; (b) what knowledge bears on the problem; (c) what kinds of actions to try to plan; (d) what specific actions to plan; and (e) how to allocate cognitive resources during planning, Within each of these categories, different specialists suggest decisions at different levels of abstraction. The activities of the various specialists are not coordinated in any systematic way. Instead, the specialists operate opportunistically, suggesting decisions whenever promising opportunities arise. The paper presents a detailed account of the model and illustrates its assumptions with a "thinking aloud" protocol. It also describes the performance of a computer simulation of the model. The paper contrasts the proposed model with successive refinement models and attempts to resolve apparent differences between the two points of view.},
