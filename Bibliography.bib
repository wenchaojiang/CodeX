abstract = {This paper systematically develops a set of general and supporting design principles and specifications for a Dynamic Emergency Response Management Information System (DERMIS) by identifying design premises resulting from the use of the Emergency Management Information System and Reference Index (EMISARI) and design concepts resulting from a comprehensive literature review. Implicit in crises of varying scopes and proportions are communication and information needs that can be addressed by todays information and communication technologies. However, what is required is organizing the premises and concepts that can be mapped into a set of generic design principles in turn providing a framework for the sensible development of flexible and dynamic Emergency Response Information Systems. A framework is presented for the system design and development that addresses the communication and information needs of first responders as well as the decision making needs of command and control personnel. The framework also incorporates thinking about the value of insights and information from communities of geographically dispersed experts and suggests how that expertise can be brought to bear on crisis decision making. Historic experience is used to suggest nine design premises. These premises are complemented by a series of five design concepts based upon the review of pertinent and applicable research. The result is a set of eight general design principles and three supporting design considerations that are recommended to be woven into the detailed specifications of a DERMIS. The resulting DERMIS design model graphically indicates the heuristic taken by this paper and suggests that the result will be an emergency response system flexible, robust, and dynamic enough to support the communication and information needs of emergency and crisis personnel on all levels. In addition it permits the development of dynamic emergency response information systems with tailored flexibility to support and be integrated across different sizes and types of organizations. This paper provides guidelines for system analysts and designers, system engineers, first responders, communities of experts, emergency command and control personnel, and MIS/IT researchers.},

abstract = {In this study, we describe how to use innovative techniques to improve the decision-making process in crisis response organizations. The focus was on building situation awareness of a crisis and overcoming pitfalls such as tunnel vision and infor- mation bias through using critical thinking. We started by observing typical difficulties in crisis management in a field study. The essential elements of concern were a deficit in sharing and communicating understanding and a patchy overview of the topics communicated, within as well as between teams. Communication frequently did not entail the reasoning behind a decision that was made. We therefore developed a criti- cal thinking tool that made the reasoning process more explicit and at the same time more robust by tying it to specific hypotheses. We studied a candidate support tool in a controlled setting and found that people made better judgments, particularly in situa- tions where they would be prone to decision biases. We subsequently extended the critical thinking tool to a team setting. We list a number of requirements that are essen- tial for support systems that intend to limit tunnel vision and alleviate communication and coordination problems in crisis response organizations.},

To understand the impact of CPOE on clinical workflow, we developed a conceptual framework and conducted a literature search for CPOE evaluations between 1990 and June 2007. Fifty-one publications were identified that disclosed mixed effects of CPOE systems. Among the frequently reported workflow advantages were the legible orders, remote accessibility of the systems, and the shorter order turnaround times. Among the frequently reported disadvantages were the time-consuming and problematic user-system interactions, and the enforcement of a predefined relationship between clinical tasks and between providers. Regarding the diversity of findings in the literature, we conclude that more multi-method research is needed to explore CPOE's multidimensional and collective impact on especially collaborative workflow.},

abstract = {Earthquake emergency response requires different number of teams to cooperate with each other and coordinate their activities to achieve global objectives. Coordination is the key challenging problem that field teams face in urban search and rescue (USAR) emergency response because of the geographic and uncertain environment. Therefore, it is necessary to optimize coordination of teams by allocating tasks to teams in time and space efficiently and sufficiently. The present paper aims to propose an efficient approach that allows humans to collaborate with coordinator assistant agents to assign tasks to teams. To achieve this purpose, we did the following stages: (1) the structure of the USAR task force and environment characteristics were analyzed, (2) we analyzed the spatial coordination problem and then modeled it, (3) features and properties of required approach were assessed, (4) we designed a contract net based model for distributed spatial task allocation and proposed the architecture of spatially distributed intelligent assistant agents (SpDI2A), and (5) finally, our approach was implemented and validated in a geospatial simulation which was developed using AnyLogic software and Java programming. The final result composes of 10 features satisfying the features of the required system.},

abstract = {When an extreme event hits an urban area, the efficiency and effectiveness of the first response have a profound effect on disaster relief efforts. The redefinition of the civil engineers role and responsibilities as first response team members, along with an enhanced collaboration between disaster relief organizations, will greatly improve first response efforts and the securing of affected infrastructures. To improve collaboration efforts, the currently used radio systems-based interaction medium needs to be modified due to the impossibility of storing, retrieving, and transferring digital information, and limited support to implement information dissemination policies. This paper presents a reliable, transparent, and portable mobile ad hoc space for collaboration (MASC) based on a short range wireless communication platform to address these limitations in order to provide more consistent and efficient collaboration among first responders. The system was designed around a robust data redundancy core, and tested through software simulations and by conducting a search and rescue exercise involving civil engineers and firefighters. The simulation results highlight that the number of machines, the replication level, the size of the replication unit, and the wireless communication range are key design elements of the system in providing high availability. The search and rescue exercise allowed this research to confirm the high availability simulation results and to demonstrate that MASC is able to adequately manage and disseminate information in disaster scenarios. These encouraging results allow this research effort to conclude that MASC is able to address these new challenges.},

Such coordination of information is usually based on national frameworks that document structures, roles, and responsibilities, but are seldom supported by relevant ICT infrastructure or systems. This paper uses the lessons learned from the exercise observations to identify future opportunities for information management software to support disaster centre operations. In particular, the paper introduces a prototypical Crisis Information Management System we are developing to support two challenges: incident notification and resource messaging. The system is based on open standards under development within the OASIS standards consortium, and will be evaluated as part of future exercises.},
