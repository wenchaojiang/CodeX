abstract = {In disasters such as the earthquake in Haiti and the tsunami in Japan, people used social media to ask for help or report injuries. The popularity, efficiency, and ease of use of social media has led to its pervasive use during the disaster. This creates a pool of timely reports about the disaster, injuries, and help requests. This offers an alternative opportunity for first responders and disaster relief organizations to collect information about the disaster, victimis, and their needs. It also presents a challenge for these organizations to aggregate and process the requests from different social media. Given the sheer volume of requests, it is necessary to filter reports and select those of high priority for decision making. Little is known about how the two phases should be smoothly integrated. In this paper we report the use of social media during a simulated crisis and crisis response process, the ASU Crisis Response Game. Its main objective is to create a training capability to understand how to use social media in crisis. We report lessons learned from this exercise that may benefit first responders and NGOs who use social media to manage relief efforts during the disaster.},

abstract = {The growing use of Instant Messaging for social and work-related communication has created a situation where incoming messages often become a distraction to users while they are performing important tasks. Staying on task at the expense of responsiveness to IM buddies may portray the users as impolite or even rude. Constantly attending to IM, on the other hand, may prevent users from performing tasks efficiently, leaving them frustrated. In this paper we present a tool that augments a commercial IM client by automatically increasing the salience of incoming messages that may deserve immediate attention, helping users decide whether or not to stay on task.
