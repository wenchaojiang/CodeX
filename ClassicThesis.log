(scrreprt)              if you really need it, because it breaks several
(scrreprt)              KOMA-Script features, i.e., option `headings' and

Package scrpage2 Warning: seems you are using a very small headheight.
(scrpage2)                If you get overfull \vbox warnings at almost every
(scrpage2)                page, you should increase headheight e.g. writing
(scrpage2)                 \setlength{\headheight}{1.1\baselineskip}
(scrpage2)                into the preamble of your document.
